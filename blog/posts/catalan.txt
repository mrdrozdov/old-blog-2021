Abstract: When iteratively sampling transitions in transition based sampling, using a uniform distribution will result in frequency counts over unique trees resembling a step function. Rather, sampling over a distribution tied to the remaining viable transition sequences given the sequence of already taken transitions will give a smooth, uniform-like set of frequency counts. Providing this distribution naively is exponential over the length of the sequence. Fortunately, there is a closed form solution for this distribution in the case of binary trees.
